   <p> Cradled in the twin Mountain ranges of Nar and Narayan is the holiest of the four main shrines – Badrinath along the left bank of river Alaknanda with the towering Neelkantha Peaks as the splendid backdrop. Once the spot was carpeted with ‘badris’ or wild berries and hence was famous as Badri van. Legend has it, when the Ganga was requested to descend to earth to help suffering humanity; the earth was enable to withstand the force of its descent. Therefore the mighty Ganga was split into 12 holy channels. Alaknanda was one of them that later became the abode of Lord Vishnu or Badrinath.</p>

   <p>According to Hindu mythology, the temple was established in the 8th century AD by the sage Adi Shankara on the spot where Vishnu is said to have meditated for thousands of years. The temple has been destroyed and rebuilt many times over the centuries, and the current structure has three main parts: the garbhagriha (sanctum), the darshan mandapa (worship hall), and the sabha mandapa (convention hall). The sanctum's conical roof is about 49 ft tall and has a small cupola on top with a gold-gilt roof. The facade is made of stone and has arched windows, and a broad stairway leads up to the main entrance, a tall, arched gateway. Inside, a large pillared hall called a mandap leads to the sanctum.</p>

   <p>According to Hindu legends, the most sacred of all rivers, Ganges (or Ganga), descended from heaven to earth at Gangotri, when Lord Shiva released the mighty river from his locks. The actual origin of the river is at Gaumukh in the Gangotri glacier, 19 km away from Gangotri and is accessible by trekking.</p>

   <p>Gangotri Dham is a sacred site in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, India. It is one of the four sites in the Char Dham pilgrimage and is considered the source of the Ganges River. According to Hindu legend, the river descended from heaven to earth at Gangotri when Lord Shiva released it from his locks. The river is called Bhagirathi at its source, but takes the name Ganga after meeting the Alaknanda at Devprayag</p>
